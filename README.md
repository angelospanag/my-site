# My personal site

My personal site (under heavy development) currently hosted on: https://www.angelospanag.me

### What did you use to make this?

I started this blog from scratch using Python 3, Django 3 and Bootstrap with minimal JavaScript for its interface. It
has been an awesome journey so far and I try to improve its looks and functionality from time to time, while updating
its content.

### Why not use a CMS like WordPress or a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby or ...insert x, y, z Jamstack tool here...?

There is currently a very vibrant ecosystem of tools to generate a blogging site effortlessly and I fully support anyone
who will choose to use one of the above. There has never been an easier time to create your own blog with minimal
effort and with no cost.

I wanted to create this site from scratch, so I can learn by doing, evolve it over time, have complete control over its
content (maybe make some interactive posts in the future) and ...simply because it is fun to try!
