        <h4>About me</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5> Favourite languages/tools for software development?</h5>
                <p>
                    Mainly Python and Go for backend development and React/JavaScript (where it's needed) for frontend
                    development. Most recently I have been enjoying using Neo4J and D3.js for storing and representing
                    graph datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had to pick my favourite, that would be Python. Amazingly readable and powerful syntax with a
                    rich ecosystem of libraries encompassing web development, machine learning, data science and desktop
                    development.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Other interests?</h5>
                <p>
                    I love listening to heavy metal and playing electric guitar, reading science-fiction and fantasy
                    books, PC gaming and especially RPGs, exercising/running.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>How can you be contacted?</h5>
                <p>For any questions, suggestions, opportunities or just to say hi, please feel free to contact me <a
                        href="/contact">here</a> or at my email/socials that I have linked on this site.</p>

        <h4>About this site</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>What did you use to make this?</h5>
                <p>
                    I started this blog from scratch using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python 3</a>, <a
                        href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django 3 </a>and
                    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> with minimal JavaScript for
                    its interface. It has been an awesome journey so far and I fully expect to change a lot of things
                    over time like improving its looks and functionality, while also updating its content.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Why not use a CMS like WordPress or a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby or <i>...insert
                    x, y, z Jamstack tool here...</i>?</h5>
                <p>
                    There is currently a very vibrant ecosystem of tools to generate a blogging site effortlessly and I
                    fully support anyone who would choose to use one of the above. There has never been an easier time
                    to create your own blog with minimal effort and with no cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create this site from scratch, so I can learn by doing, evolve it over time, have
                    complete control over its content (maybe make some interactive posts in the future) and ...simply
                    because it is fun to try!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Is the code for this site open-sourced?</h5>
                <p>
                    Yes! It is currently on <a href="https://github.com/angelospanag/my-site">GitHub</a>.
