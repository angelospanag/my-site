        <h4>About me</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5> Favourite languages/tools for software development?</h5>
                <p>
                    Mainly Python and Go for backend development and React/JavaScript (where its needed) for frontend
                    development. Most recently I have been enjoying using Neo4J and D3.js for storing and representing
                    graph datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had to pick my favourite, that would be Python. Amazingly readable and powerful syntax with a
                    rich
                    ecosystem of
                    libraries encompassing web development, machine learning, data science and desktop development.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Other interests?</h5>
                <p>
                    I love listening to heavy metal and playing electric guitar, reading science-fiction and fantasy
                    books, PC gaming and especially RPGs, exercising/running.
                </p>

        <h4>About this site</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>What did you use to make this?</h5>
                <p>
                    I started this blog from scratch using Python 3, Django 3 and Bootstrap with minimal JavaScript for
                    its interface. It has been an awesome journey so far and I try to improve its looks and
                    functionality from time to time, while updating its content.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Why not use a CMS like WordPress or a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby or <i>...insert
                    x, y, z Jamstack tool here...</i>?</h5>
                <p>
                    There is currently a very vibrant ecosystem of tools to generate a blogging site effortlessly and I
                    fully
                    support
                    anyone who
                    will choose to use one of the above. There has never been an easier time to create your own blog
                    with
                    minimal effort and with no cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create this site from scratch, so I can learn by doing, evolve it over time, have
                    complete
                    control
                    over its content (maybe make some interactive posts in the future) and ...simply because it is fun
                    to
                    try!
                </p>

            </li>

            <li><h5>Is the code for this site open-sourced?</h5>
                <p>
                    Yes! It is currently on <a href="https://github.com/angelospanag/my-site">GitHub</a>.
